# What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?

(1) Information Gathering: A web developer must consider the purpose of the site, set goals, consider demographics and collect information to aim at desired targerts, and ascertain the kind of content the audience will be looking for

(2) Planning: This is where the site map is developed and desicions of which technologies will be implemented

(3) Design: determining the look and feel of the website

(4) Development: creation of a functional website

(5) Testing and Delivery: website is tested for things like functionality, compatability, etc. and delivered (often to a client)

(6) Maintenance: Fixing bugs, updating content, things of this nature


# What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?

My site will be an online resume, so to speak.  I intend to sell myself as an employee by posting a portfolio of past work and give a concrete example of my skills.  Hopefully that will include websites and web apps that we've developed as a team at DBC.


What is your target audience's interests and how do you see
your site addressing them?

My demographic is employers, particularly those either in the tech industry or on the tech side of a business.  The site should address them with a working portfolio, showing I can put my money where my mouth is, and the design and ease of the site itself.  This may be a time where you should judge a book by it's cover.


#What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.

First, they should be lead to my portfolio so the work can speak for itself.  If they want my information on my prowess, they can look to the blog.  Hopefully, by then, they'll want to contact me and, if interested, they can also be informed of who I am in the 'About Me' section.


#What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?

Design is about problem solving and understanding that though other sites might have interested designs, those solutions stand alone unto themselves.  A developer must look at what works best in solving how to manage their current project and what works for the contracted company and their target audience.  And while User Experience is difficult to measure (largely due to it's subjectivity), it should still be taken into consideration.  UX will aim to ensure a pleasant, affective, meaningful experience for the user by how useful, credible, desirable, or valuable the site is (to name a few.).  But UX is not a standard design and varies for each audience, just like design problem solving.

#What is user experience design and why is it valuable?

UX tries to increase user user satisfaction in the use of the website. Creating a pleasant atmosphere and experience for the user increases the chances they will return, use, and rely on the site.

#Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

I actually did a fair amount of reading about UX. I went to a few blogs.  Here's a few:

  (b) http://www.usability.gov/what-and-why/user-experience.html
  (c) http://blog.crazyegg.com/2012/07/24/what-is-user-experience/
I know that this topic is important and that I will need to incorporate these practices to make myself a better developer, but I did struggle to read through some of it because I did find it tedious.  I wanted to be more interested, and though I was a little, it was hard to keep focus.
