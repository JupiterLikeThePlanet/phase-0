#What is a wireframe?

The wireframe is the skeleton of a webpage.  A very basic layout of the elements desired and where they will be placed on the page

#What are the benefits of wireframing?

It is beneficial to wireframe as a part of planning.  Laying out a visual (and probably recommended several drafts) gives a developer an image of how the page will be laid out, how to navigate through the site, evaluate the user interface and interactive elements, what to code for, and how effective the layout is

#Did you enjoy wireframing your site?

I did.  It's a creative process so it's well enjoyable.

#Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?

I created a second draft and used that.

#What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?

Most of my questions were about layout.  I wanted a minimalist approach.  I had a layout that was effective for a photography portfolio that I made years ago.  But I had to ask myself would that work for resume website like the one we're trying to create. I understood that I could take inspiration from that site, but I'd need to format it to my current needs. After making a couple of drafts, I think I sorted it out.

#Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?

Again, making the inline was most tedious.  However, I did enjoy making the wireframe.
