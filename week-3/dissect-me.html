#What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?

My most common tags include:
<!DOCTYPE>
<html>
<head>
<title>
<body>
<p>
<h1-6>

These elements are the basics and essential to the principle structure of any web page (well maybe <h1-6> is more style, but I still use it alot.)  If a developer is to convey the any information on a site, these would be the minimum amount of tags to know in order to execute that

#How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?

Using a few different references, it seems like this would be the layout and order within the <body>:
<header>
  <nav>
    <article>
    <section>
    <aside> / <figure>
    <p> / <div>
<footer>

[Note: I've seen some places where article and section are switched, but I'll stick with the html5 doctor link we reviewed in session. Besides not all content has sections]

#What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?

We learned how to create a snippet, however, it didn't work for us.  Our guide looked over the code and said it looked right, but still something was wrong. However, I do now know the structure in which to create one.  I'll probably create snippets later tailored to whatever work I end up doing down the line.  I can see my self using it while making a website consisting of many pages, particularly if each page is similiar structurally.  You'd want to have a template ready for that.
