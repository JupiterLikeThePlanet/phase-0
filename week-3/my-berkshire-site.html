<!--
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?

Oddly enough, I'd learned some html when formatting my myspace page way back in college.  However, I hadn't really done a full page before.  It's a creative endeavor.  It's fun to build something, just like any other craft.  You have something to appreciate for your effort.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
Y'know, compared to the past programming language I've learned, it's been simple to digest which makes the whole research process quite fun for me.  The results of your html efforts show up almost instaneously and you get a sense of what you're trying to build right off the bat.  Ergo, you get a sense of accomplishment and direction quickly which plays upon the eagerness to continue and learn more.


- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)

I did have to run it through the Markup Validation Service a few times.  It spotted a few unclosed errors (rookie mistake *face palm*), but I managed to close them up.  Oddly, once or twice,  a couple of elements that were unclosed, but that did have closed tags.  I wasn't certain what that was.  I played around with it and it looked fine on the site, but the error still came up.


- What seems good and bad about HTML?

The good seems that it has a low barrier of entry and immediate results of your efforts.  The downside is that the language seems like it can be a bit verbose between the tags.  However, with my dearth of experience, I feel as if I can't really speak to it's pros and cons yet.


- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?

At the moment, nothing is too complex that memorisation can't handle.  I mean, knowing what tags stand for is key and the terms seem self explanatory
