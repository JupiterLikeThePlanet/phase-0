// Pseudocode
//President in vote count needs a key value pair of "BOB" which is equal to three which is the number of votes talled for him
//Repeat the above for vicePresident, secretary, treasurer.
//for officers, we need to declare the winners for each position.

//Steps:
//-Take the key and value pairs for each position in the votes variable and assign it to each key in the voteCount variable.
//-use a for loop to itterate through each position and use a +=1 to add the votes for each key in the variable voteCount
//-to display the winners, iterate through the voteCount objects to grab president, vp, secrectary, treasurer properties
//- then go through 2nd iteration to grab number of votes
//- create conditional and set a var to 0
//    - where we iterate through votes, as iteration progresses the var is set to the highest number as it passes along
//tally who the winner is and then add that winner as a property of the specifed object in the variable officers

/* Reflection
(1) What did you learn about iterating over nested objects in JavaScript?

How to handle double or nested iterations, learing the control flow and how to access properties

(2) Were you able to find useful methods to help you with this?

Just sticking with the fundamentals to get a better grasp of them.  We nested for loops in a for loop, as well as conditional statements.  Just trying to better understand material we already covered and using more of their potential.

(3) What concepts were solidified in the process of working through this challenge?

How to navigate through nested objects.
